What is Python?
Python is a high-level, interactive, interpreted and object-oriented programming language.It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

Python is High Level - Written in a form that is close to our human language. No particular knowledge of the hardware is needed as high level languages create programs that are portable and not tied to a particular computer or microchip.
Python is Interactive – Programmer can interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs using Python prompt.
Python is Interpreted − Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it.
Python is Object-Oriented − Python supports all the Object-Oriented techniques such as Class, Object, Methods, Inheritance ,Encapsulation and Polymorphism

What is Scope of Python?
Python in used to create:

Web Applications
Chatbots
Video Games
Automating Application
Artificial Intelligence algorithms
Desktop Applications..etc.., 



How easy to learn Python?
Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
No need of programming background.
Simplest programming language when compared to all other programming languages.

Python Syntax compared to other programming languages
Example 1: Hello World Program: Java vs Python


The same program in Python can be coded as below:
  # Sample Code
  print(&quot;Hello World&quot;)
  
  Output:
  Hello World


Example 2: Swap the 2 numbers : C vs Python


The same program in Python can be coded as below:
  # Sample Code
  a, b = 6, 13
  a, b = b, a
  print(a, b) 

  Output:
  13 6


Example 3: Count total number of times “python” word is displayed: VB Script vs Python


The same program in Python can be coded as below:
  # Sample Code
  str = &quot;Welcome to Python Tutorials. Python is a general purpose high level  programming language.We will study about features of Python, use of Python,  advantages of Python and disadvantages of Python.Thank you&quot;
  
  print(str.count(&quot;Python&quot;)

  Output:
  6


Features of Python
Simple and easy to learn 
Free ware and open source 
High Level programming language
Platform Independent 
Portable 
Dynamically Typed

Limitations of Python
It is not suitable for Enterprise application   
It is not used for mobile application
